#### Mundane activities

1.  Got up. Brought chocolate milk to work. Forgot to bring my earpods with me. Thus no podcast on the road.
2.  Bumped into Cassie when getting out from the Shatin station. Daily mundane serendipity ❤.
3.  Got a maxim chocolate bun for breakfast. With the chocolate milk from D. Long time no eat.
4.  As a typical introvert, I was reluctant to attend the Annual Dinner to be held in the coming Friday. Plus there was one conference I was interested in, so I applied leave for this Friday. Dai lo found me this morning to ask about if I was planned to skip the AD. I said yeah as it would be troublesome to travel. Then he passed me the Airport Express Line Ticket.
5.  Went to the post office after work with the application docs. Found the main entrance closed and troublesome to take the detour so I then left for home.
6.  Watched some episodes of the TVB law series. Realistic.
7.  Regular 20 nos. of jumping, and a bit too tired to peel off the circle and write the record.

#### Writing Practice

Is it always the case to be mentally drained? The availability of infinite numbers of possible directions is messing with my mind. There are tons of information I can research for and read about. There are tons of ideal rewards that I could go for with sacrifices on different aspects. What is it that I am inclined for?

Put those meaningless thoughts and possibilities aside first, I am reflecting on my method of this weekday records. The short pieces written here seemed too fragmented to benefit me for any improvement. My laziness also prevailed some days to prevent me from sticking to the recording plan. And should i pratice more for writing in Chinese instead? I will take January as the trial month, review and revise my approach for more streamlized practice. Tentatively, I will relocate all those writing practices into one post draft, on medium or not. Then later I should set aside sometime to review and organise to make those pieces connected and form a complete context.

For work, those unfinished tasks are dragging me from feeling relief. I will explore the benefits of utilising the tasks managers for better self prioritization and communication with teammates and supervisors. Also a time to explore the future. Please act. Dump your cowardly fear.
