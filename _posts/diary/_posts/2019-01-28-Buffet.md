#### Mundane activities

1.  Sweet sunshine and city scene. The charming smell after a shower.
2.  Went to fairwood for a rich breakfast. Beef, scrambled egg and milk tea. A senior colleague was behind me in the queue.
3.  After the satisfaction obtained by consuming the breakfast, I suddenly recalled that we have a team lunch buffet scheduled. Calorie intake alarms.
4.  Whole team departed for 2+2 cafe, passing the newly-built cinema, which was a cozy place to chill out, completely different from the deserted construction site it used to be when I lived in shatin. Things never stop changing.
5.  The dessert selection at the buffet was crazy. I had chocolate tart, chocolate cake, strawberry yogurt cake, light chocolate mini cake with chocolate sauce and 4 bowls of movenpick.
6.  Finished binge-watching the dump TVB law soap opera. Mixed with absurd plots while some of the reflection still resonating with my mindset towards this city and this world. All about human connections, care, belief and hope, and the place you regard as home.
7.  Regular 20 nos. of jumping, and a bit too tired to peel off the circle and write the record.

#### Writing Practice

I am currently on the train: west rail line. Next station is Austin, as broadcast by the train voice. There was a couple sitting in front of me watching at one phone monitor with unfinished WhatsApp message typing interface. Probably thinking about whether to update their friends about their impulse wedding decision. A middle-aged guy in a common black coat and black shoes with a black backpack (and there was a black umbrella in his backpack) was playing with his fingers out of boredom or anxiety. That was the same small unconscious movements of which I presented and got pointed out by my friend during my mock interview last year. As I typed the above paragraph, the train already passed Austin and arrived in Nam Cheong. The all-black men took off at this station. He’s a typical Asian with relatively small black eyes and short black hair thinly scattered over his head. A guy that you can find at every sight at everywhere in HK, a character is so mediocre that I will not remember, recall or even recognize once after he disappears with the crowd. I walked out off the train and went across the platform to wait for another mtr line to come. Then I recalled I planned to walk home from Nam Cheong today. The word “mediocre” stayed in my mind as the image of that all-black guy dimed. When I was taking the escalators to ascend from Exit C underground to the outside world, I found my fingers fidgeted unconsciously again.
