#### Picture of the day

Pretties whom I came across when wondering in HS during lunch break

#### Mundane activities

1.  Got up. Browsed some info. Departed a bit late. Grabbed coffee with VC. She’s doing great yet mentioned about the low work efficiency due to outdated administrative system.
2.  I failed to resist the temptation of fries for lunch. So I went to beans and ordered my regular beans lunch: chicken panini with fries.
3.  When I was waiting for that takeaway, I wandered around another floor of Homesquare. There was a bright well-decorated electric shop, with displays of dandy items such as smart watches and Dyson vacuum machines. Once I walked in, a staff wearing a nice black outfit (similar to a suit, or it is a suit) approached and tried to introduce staff. When I found the display of Yaman machines and asked about the price, he started to demonstrate the usage of Yaman like a Beauty Advisor. The setup seemed fun. Salute to the professional staff.
4.  Found a position with the deadline today about BIM. Yet I am not qualified in terms of nos. of years of experience. Discussed with some senior ex-colleague friend, I appreciate the comments and perspectives that keep me aware about the reality of this profession and current industry. Thought about CIC’s BIM fund, one more thing on my to-do list now.
5.  Asked C and T for dinner near my office so that I could head back to the office for some productive work. However, we ate til 7pm and I headed to the mtr with C instead eventually. Another low productivity day aha.
6.  Feeling extremely sad and down on my way back home. Thought about SB who had the assertive outlook even when without a particular direction in mind. Why are the connections fading or freezing? Where am I going and how do you do?
7.  Regular 20 nos. of jumping, my Mi cleaning robot performed nice work today.

#### Writing Practice

我最近总是昏昏欲睡。现在打着字又几乎睡着。今天听的广播讲地球上的五次生物大灭绝，人类最记得的就是那恐龙的灭绝，那场灾难抹掉了恐龙的影子，也留下了日后几百万年哺乳动物繁衍生息称霸地球的伏笔。当我们换成用一个亿年为时间单位去看事情想事情，一切只为浮生若梦。

(二月六日大年初二补记:这几天持续着严重的拖延症，在密集而长时间的人际关系互动中精神筋疲力竭，被家庭束缚压抑以及过度关心的愤怒和抑郁、对前路方向的迷茫和对自由的渺望、对备齐道德理智责任中庸尽孝道路的愧疚交杂着像一坨乱麻把我本来就不大的心给吃掉。要振作。多读书，多做事，少想七想八。）
