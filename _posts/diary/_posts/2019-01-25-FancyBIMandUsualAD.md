#### Picture of the day

#### Mundane activities

1.  Got up later than planned. Sunshine day.
2.  Had the breakfast at McDonald’s with DY. 2 sets of chicken cheeseburger with soy milk. One of the burgers with the special request of no sauce. The special burger requested turned out to be a Sausage McMuffin.Walked to Mong Kok Langham Hotel for the seminar. Timing was just perfect.
3.  Unexpected excellent food was served during the breaks of the BIM seminar. Gorgeous. Also eased my cash flow problem.
4.  The BIM talks made me wonder about the enormous possibility to boost productivity/working efficiency. Also made me wonder and can not wait to see when AI will conquer the world.
5.  Went back home after several talks. Showered and dressed for the AD at night. Then went to the AD with my Bata slippers, carrying the heels in a paper bag of course.
6.  Met many old colleagues and took quite some photos at the AD. Time is fleeting.
7.  SL suddenly told me she will come tonight and stay for 2 days to join my lunch treat tomorrow. So she came to join me at the Olympic Station after my commute back from AD by airport express line. Good as there’s not much time wasted in waiting.

#### Writing Practice

Today’s not a good day. I’ve been procrastinating again for my record writing and other creative works. For this post, I was actually typing it 4 days after the actual day, i.e. in the midnight of next Monday. I’ve been upset and anxious about my directions and future. I went to socializing events for 3 consecutive days: ice ceremony, seminar and AD, and the lunch treat. I was mentally exhausted and wanted to bury myself into some sand or hide in a tree hole for 3 days without any human-interaction for recovery.

There was one hit article in WeChat media by a guy at his age of 30 elaborating his own self-reflection towards life, work, class, and the overall purposes. I found that anxiety, confusion, gratitude for life and serendipity for beautiful occurrences resonating with me.

I am not feeling good. I feel inferior when I compared myself with the world, the world full of miracles and the talented. I feel that I was redundant and no matter what work or things I do will not matter. I still believe this to be the ultimate sad truth. Is there anything I can do about it? Not really, as far as I know.
