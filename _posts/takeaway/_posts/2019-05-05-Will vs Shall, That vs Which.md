Capture from *The Element of Style*.


* Shall vs Will

> In formal writing, the future tense requires *shall* for the first person, *will* for the second and third. The formula to express the speaker's belief regarding a future action or state is *I shall*; *I will* expresses determination or consent.
> 
> A swimmer in distress cries, "I shall drown; no one will save me!"
> A suicide puts it the other way:"I will drown; no one shall save me!"
 
 

* That vs Which

> *That* is the defining, or restrictive pronoun, *which* the nondefining, or nonrestrictive.
> 
> Careful writers, watchfull for small conveniences, go *which*-hunting, remove the defining *whiches*, and by so doing improve their work.
