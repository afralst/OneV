The first week of my ICE writing course ended. We set to read and discuss on [The Critic As Artist by Oscar Wilde](http://www.wilde-online.info/the-critic-as-artist.html). I got immediately impressed once I started reading. Below I cap some resonating / witty paragraphs of it:-

> Even in actual life egotism is not without its attractions. When people talk to us about others they are usually dull. When they talk to us about themselves they are nearly always interesting, and if one could shut them up, when they become wearisome, as easily as one can shut up a book of which one has grown wearied, they would be perfect absolutely.
