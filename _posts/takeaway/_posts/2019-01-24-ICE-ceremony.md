#### Mundane activities

1.  In the midnight, I steam-ironed my bronze blouse and white shirt. The wrinkles of the white remained.
2.  I wore the boots for work and packed the heels for the ceremony. Also took the black bags to carry the coming certificate.
3.  Lunch with BCF peers to farewell GL. Everyone has his/her own direction and bright futures ahead. Best wishes.
4.  Today learned that GL’s next job was the one the disappeared HH was referring to. Good to know that at least that guy was not a fraud or doing fishing calls.
5.  ICE ceremony. Met some old friends. Took some photos. People came with families, partners, black and white suits, flower bouquets and professional-level cameras with huge lens. We queued to go on the stage to take photos with empty certificates.
6.  DY came after the ceremony. Took a detour before reaching a local Vietnamese restaurant. Then we walked passing two stations to Hong Kong. Neon lights shined.
7.  Regular 20 nos. of jumping, and a bit too tired to peel off the circle and write the record.

#### Writing Practice

My feet are cold. Should I do something to change this status? There’s a lot of small things I can do for the improvement. For instance, one of the most effective way: I can go get a bucket of hot water and soak my feet in it. Over 10 minutes my feet and hands would be warmer than ever. In the meantime, I can enjoy a time of being dumb and empty-minded, watching soap operas where all characters are so open to the people around them and always having strong expressions with their emotions deep down and talking to their friends about all those bullshits and nonsense. And their friends would actually act as if they care. Is that one of the reasons why I can stand the stupid plot of the shows? Do I find it ridiculous, or admire their braveness and willingness to be open and vulnerable in front of others? Or is it the way they demonstrate their strong bondings by always hanging out together and talking about their thoughts and feelings. Seems to be a difficult one for an introvert? But it’s stupid and lame to limit yourself by categorizing yourself into a personality tag.
