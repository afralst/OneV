The first week of my ICE writing course ended. We set to read and discuss on [The Critic As Artist by Oscar Wilde](http://www.wilde-online.info/the-critic-as-artist.html). I got immediately impressed once I started reading. Below I cap some resonating / witty paragraphs of it:-

> GILBERT. 
> Even in actual life egotism is not without its attractions. When people talk to us about others they are usually dull. When they talk to us about themselves they are nearly always interesting, and if one could shut them up, when they become wearisome, as easily as one can shut up a book of which one has grown wearied, they would be perfect absolutely.

> ERNEST.  
> I don’t want music just at present. It is far too indefinite. ... whatever music sounds like I am glad to say that it does not sound in the smallest degree like German.  
> GILBERT (rising from the piano).  
> ... After playing Chopin, I feel as if I had been weeping over sins that I had never committed, and mourning over tragedies that were not my own. Music always seems to me to produce that effect. It creates for one a past of which one has been ignorant, and fills one with a sense of sorrows that have been hidden from one’s tears.
I can fancy a man who had led a perfectly commonplace life, hearing by chance some curious piece of music, and suddenly discovering that his soul, without his being conscious of it, had passed through terrible experiences, and known fearful joys, or wild romantic loves, or great renunciations. And so tell me this story, Ernest. I want to be amused.

> GILBERT.    
> Browning... His work is marred by struggle, violence and effort, and he passed not from emotion to form, but from thought to chaos. Still, he was great. He has been called a thinker, and was certainly a man who was always thinking, and always thinking aloud; but it was not thought that fascinated him, but rather the processes by which thought moves. It was the machine he loved, not what the machine makes.

> ERNEST. But what are the two supreme and highest arts?  
> GILBERT. Life and Literature, life and the perfect expression of life.

> To have a capacity for a passion and not to realise it, is to make oneself incomplete and limited.

> GILBERT.  
Our historical sense is at fault. Every century that produces poetry is, so far, an artificial century, and the work that seems to us to be the most natural and simple product of its time is always the result of the most self-conscious effort. Believe me, Ernest, __there is no fine art without self-consciousness, and self-consciousness and the critical spirit are one.

>GILBERT.   
More difficult to do a thing than to talk about it? Not at all. That is a gross popular error. It is very much more difficult to talk about a thing than to do it. In the sphere of actual life that is of course obvious. Anybody can make history. Only a great man can write it. There is no mode of action, no form of emotion, that we do not share with the lower animals. It is only by language that we rise above them, or above each other—by language, which is the parent, and not the child, of thought. Action, indeed, is always easy, and when presented to us in its most aggravated, because most continuous form, which I take to be that of real industry, becomes simply the refuge of people who have nothing whatsoever to do. No, Ernest, don’t talk about action. It is a blind thing dependent on external influences, and moved by an impulse of whose nature it is unconscious. It is a thing incomplete in its essence, because limited by accident, and ignorant of its direction, being always at variance with its aim. Its basis is the lack of imagination. It is the last resource of those who know not how to dream.

>When man acts he is a puppet. When he describes he is a poet.
