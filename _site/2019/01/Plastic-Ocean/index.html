  <li>Got up late, at around 8:30 am. And still sleepy.</li>
  <li>With the messed-up schedule during weekends with over-crowded social
events, I eventually went on with nerve last night and informed MC
that I would skip the Sunday gathering. This morning CT messaged me
when I was on my way to work, and she spent like 20mins to debate to
show how I should act as appropriate in her opinion for paying my
share for the party venue they decided instead of buying a more
expensive cake. Ruined my day. But I had left middle school so let
it go. I should take note that people are just people. And I should
be more assertive since the beginning.</li>
  <li>YK told me that for our trial episode about North Point, GQ’s
reaction was “he only made it played for 1 min”. XD. Long way to go.</li>
  <li>Got a call with a headhunter. It was short, not containing
much information but quite smooth.</li>
  <li>Had lunch with RS, she’s been away for quite some time due to some
personal issues. Glad that she would talk about it with me. We
talked about directions for heading back to hometown, and staying.
About family and work. Grateful and feeling lucky to have her here.</li>
  <li>Searched around for the cake to buy for compensation. Hesitant among
Italian Tomato, Twinkle baker decor and more. Cheesecake or Final
choice was Paul Lafayet. Look at all those fancy cakes.</li>
  <li>Did regular jumping (20 + 20) in the house. Justdanced 1 songs.</li>
</ol>

<p>Then I am typing this record, then peeling off the circle of [2019 Jan
4] and going to bed, with my tiny heater on for the whole night.</p>

<h4 id="writing-practice">Writing practice</h4>

<p>Wong is a bit nervous. The holiday season is coming and he is challenged
to get 3/4 of his stuff sorted and cleared.</p>

<p>Wong has a huge cabinet. However, all his pajamas, jackets, T-shirts,
jeans, coats were either scattered on his sofa or hidden somewhere mixed
with other clothes in that cabinet like fruits mixed in a salad bowl.</p>

<p>Wong is often depressed, feeling a sense of being inferior as he feels
he could not keep up with the fashion trend and he is not attractive to
another human being. He does not possess an outstanding body shape or a
charming look. He believes that he would easily blend into any crowd
with his mediocre appearance. There was a time when he struggled to
stand out, by trying lots of bright yellow or shimmering outfits and
replacing each walking step with a hyper jump. He targeted to get
himself distinguished with a clear characteristic. Yet his own doubt
very soon stopped him from being persistent and gaining actual
attention. His outfits are like a periodic function, drifting from a
black-and-white or brown-and-light-brown office set to a cheerful
fluorescent yellow. Wong is hesitant and sleepy.</p>
