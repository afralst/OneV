    <p>~19°C</p>

<ol>
  <li>Got up late (~8:20 am), thought about DM and smiled.</li>
  <li>When I arrived PCC and was waiting for AR to get the coffee order.
The cute long-hair staff remembered my soymilk mocha and made the
drink in advance. Felt warm.</li>
  <li>Got to know the good news of AR getting his wardrobe set up finally
as well as his night bike campaign with Angus. Wonder how Angus’s
doing!</li>
  <li>Started checking on the junior’s work and found it triggering my
headache. Got the good news that VC, one of my close colleagues who
left and went to WSD, was still located in Shatin.</li>
  <li>DM told me about his thought for building an accounting/budgeting
app just for his own use, and the initiatives to review the inflow
and outflow. Reminded me of my cash flow problem, which is a little
bit (1 out of 10) depressing. Still, feeling positive as impacted by
his determination and calmness.</li>
  <li>Amazed to find that there are skiing and snowboarding venues in
Shenzhen’s Window of the World. Maybe I will go later. Or to the
頑雪 place. Also bookmarked coastal architectural landmarks in
Qinhuangdao.</li>
  <li>Did Regular jumping (20 + 20) in the house.</li>
</ol>

<p>I already took a shower and peeled off the circle of [2019 Jan 7].
Now I am typing this record, and will soon go to bed.</p>

Jan 7)</p>

<p>I’ve become numb about many things. I’ve lost contact with some of my
friends. I’ve delayed or missed a proper response time for some of my
friends’ private messages. I am feeling overwhelmed with tons of social
activities crowded in my calendar, all those overthinking shit deep
inside my mind and also worrying about earthling troubles in terms of
materialism vs environmentalism vs Buddhism.</p>

<p>Fortunately, I felt tranquil last Sunday. DM accompanied me all the way
to the north for my dentist visit. He was so calm, it seemed like that
he already had everything and knew what he wanted, therefore not
bothered about his having to watch a dull Chinese documentary in a
cinema due to peer pressure.</p>

<p>&lt;Four Springs&gt;, A film that was too true depicting life to be
dramatic. Thus not astonishing at all in any sense, especially compared
with the Spiderman animation. However, it was a pleasant one that
encourages you to love life and to live more. To contribute or
accomplish a small step for the family every day. To sing and dance
together with the loved one regardless the age or seasons. Glad that we
had shared the screening together. The dish of beef at “外婆家” was also
wonderful.</p>
